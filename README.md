# Extracting list of restaurants, restaurant events and threshold for ratings
## This program was developed from 23 March 2024 to 24 March 2024 for all 3 sub-tasks. This is my first time hosting my program into Github. 
#### Instructions to run the code 

###### 1. Click on CC4_Career_Coach folder
###### 2. Click on CC4_Career_Coach.py python file 
###### 3. Copy the entire code and paste it on your IDE. 
###### 4. Run the entire program and you'll see the determined rating threshold from the output terminal. 
###### 5. Access restaurant.csv and restaurant_events.csv in your IDE project folder. If you are using Visual Studio, then you would be able to view these csv files in your Visual Studio project folder. For example, CC4_Career_Coach folder is my visual studio project folder. Thus, you can access to my 2 csv files in my folder via github.
